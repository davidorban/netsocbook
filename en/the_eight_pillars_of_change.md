# The Eight Pillars Of Change

Our technology has permeated throughout every level of our society. We’ve been extremely proliferative with our ingenuity to create every possible tool capable of aiding us, from the most mundane to the most complex of tasks. Everything we see around us is a product of our technology, a research and development experiment which has spanned the thousand of years and undergone countless of iterations of trial and error. We’ve become so used to how easy life has become thanks to it that the most trivial absence of whatever items from one of our daily habit is enough to create a mild panic. This is due to our being technological creatures, depending on it to stay at the apex of life on this planet and foraging our future with each new invention. Our society has changed face many times thanks to it, affected by our furthered understanding of the world around us on the small and big big scale. As thus we can’t pinpoint a particular one aspect that would be nominated the most impactful of all the other technologies but, cross examining this set with the basic and most relevant functions of a society we can select a few which could be interpreted together to form a model of future organizations. We’ve called them “pillars of change” for they represent the dynamic foundation which will serve as a basis for the socio-economical transition in the future world’s society. The choice has been made in order to give a comprehensive view of what the leading technological trends of today’s world are while also keeping within sight important perspectives of how impactfully changed they will be in the future. It could be argued that this set has skipped on some topics that could be considered relevant as well, but involving each and any technological categories into the conversation would only serve to sway our focus from the most relevant of transformations that are happening around us, those that will prove to be the most transformative.
We have distilled eight pillars of change, listed here without any kind of ranking:


* Energy
* Manufacturing
* Food
* Health
* Culture And Learning
* Finance
* Trust and Security
* Governance and Policy



We will now get into a deeper exploration of these seemingly very different topics to understand how, throughout human history, they’ve helped shape our societies, through ever improving iterations which caught up to the present point of disruptive change. These many aspects of our world intertwine with each other, aided by technologies which allow synergy to arise now more then ever, sprouting new, interesting social dynamics as a response from the global organism. Always symbiotic to the others, these fields will shape the future of our society, or Network Society as we’ll come to understand.
