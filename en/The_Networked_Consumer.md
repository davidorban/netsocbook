# The Networked Consumer

*Niki Siropoulou*

In todays networked society we have moved away from the “read only” culture, a one way communication with consumers and citizens. Until the last decade, people could listen but not answer back. Listen to Radio, watch TV or read the newspaper and with the exception of a few phone calls and maybe a letter to the editor “the answer back” feature in our society was disabled. Moreover, consumers were not able to share experiences and opinions about products and services. But not anymore. The networked consumer is here and is going to change the way we produce and consume products and services.

In the past decade, our society has become more and more digitally connected. The stats are staggering, today there are 3.1 billion internet users. Around 40% of the world population has an internet connection today. In 1995, it was less than 1%. The number of internet users has increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013.
The first billion was reached in 2005. The second billion in 2010. The third billion in 2014. In 2014, nearly 75% (2.1 billion) of all internet users in the world (2.8 billion) live in the top 20 countries. The remaining 25% (0.7 billion) is distributed among the other 178 countries, each representing less than 1% of total users.  China, the country with most users (642 million in 2014), represents nearly 22% of total, and has more users than the next three countries combined (United States, India, and Japan). Among the top 20 countries, India is the one with the lowest penetration: 19% and the highest yearly growth rate. At the opposite end of the range, United States, Germany, France, U.K., and Canada have the highest penetration: over 80% of population in these countries has an internet connection. At the rate of its current growth, the web will inevitably become an integral part  of every day life in which you can either utilize your advantage or deprive yourself of immense opportunity. 

In the network society era, the emergence of the “networked consumer” is a fact and it has changed forever the way companies interact with consumers and develop products and services.

Companies who can adapt in the new way of interacting with the consumers will get a competitive advantage.

Today consumers communicate, create communities, support, invest, create and review with other peers products and services and participate in Crowdsourcing, Crowd funding, trust platforms and competitions. 

My Experience meeting the Networked Consumer.
In the past twenty years I have worked for consumer products and services as a  Marketing and Product development senior executive in companies such as Procter & Gamble, Estee Lauder, Carlsberg and have experienced “first hand” this shift from consumer to Networked consumer. From analog to digital.

At the University of Texas at Austin back in 1992, were I was studying for my MBA, our Business School was one of the very few that gave access to its students  email address. I was even assigned a project that required to work  with fellow students around the world in different time zones using only our email account. Who could foresee that what sounded like an “odd assignment” would be our reality today. 

Upon my graduation in 1993, I started working for Procter & Gamble and within a few months all marketing executives had access to email for the first time. A year later I purchased my first mobile phone, a Nokia and it was my first step in the networked consumer era. 
However, the world back then was very serious about paper. Our brand book at Pantene brand was actually a huge dossier with all brand information printed, and neatly filed. Each one of us in the marketing department would carry a heavy file with all brand data, schedule etc.  Information was analog and hard to manage.

For a marketing professional, understanding the consumer is the outmost priority and consumer research is a way to ask questions and get answers. Answers that can help you understand what products and services to develop and market them successfully.

So in the beginning of my career we would place quantitative or qualitative research as a way to ask and receive meaningful answers. In the case of qualitative research, we would gather 10-15 consumers in a room with a two way mirror where psychologists from one side of the mirror would ask various questions regarding usage and attitude towards a product and we marketing people would watch them and try to figure out answers. Another way to get answers was via quantitative research. Researchers would knock doors, or station in the high traffic streets of the city and politely stop consumers and ask them to participate in a research. Countless of pages were turned, filled, marked and processed and a few months later we had the results in printed transparences that were projected by hand, one by one. Time was slow and information was a privilege. The only way to connect with the consumers was via expensive, time consuming and cumbersome market research. 

Soon enough my personal Nokia cellphone, became a company phone and later an apple iphone, leaving Nokia almost bankrupt until Microsoft  bought it on April 25th, 2014  for 8.1 billion  -a fraction of what its  140 capitalization 8 years ago!

The first Example of Networked Consumer: Threadless the first Crowd Sourcing company.
The summer of 2008 I was attending an executive course at Harvard Business School and here it is a case about threadless company. 
Karim Lakhani was teaching the case of co-founders Jake Nickell and Jacob DeHart, who at the age of 19, started Threadless in 2000 with $1,000. Threadless began as a t-shirt design, a forum where users experimented with computers, code, and art. Nickell and DeHart invited users to post their designs on a dreamless thread (hence the name Threadless), and they would print the best designs on t-shirts.
Shortly after the first batch of shirts was printed, the founders built a website for Threadless and introduced a voting system where designs could be scored 1 to 5. By 2002, Jake Nickell had quit his full-time job, dropped out of art school, and the company moved from his apartment to a 900-square-foot office.
A new batch of t-shirts was printed once the previous batch had sold out. In 2000, Threadless would print shirts every few months. By 2004, the company was printing new shirts every week. In 2004, profit was around $1.5 million, and in 2006 it jumped to $6.5 million.
In a 2006 wired article, Jeff Howe coined the term crowdsourcing. Jeff Howe soon associated Threadless with crowdsourcing.
In 2008, Threadless was featured on the cover of Inc. as “The Most Innovative Small Company in America.”[8] Though Nickell did not disclose revenues for the article, Inc. estimated $30 million sales and a 30% profit margin. "Threadless completely blurs that line of who is a producer and who is a consumer," said Karim Lakhani our professor at Harvard Business School that summer. "The customers end up playing a critical role across all its operations: idea generation, marketing, sales forecasting. All that has been distributed." Since 2008 “Networked Consumer” is accelerating exponentially.

What is Crowdsourcing: is the act of a company or Institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined and generally large network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer production when the job is performed collaboratively but is often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and a large network of potential laborers.

Big companies have gotten into the action with crowdsourcing.  Anheuser Busch now relies on the crowd to craft beers. General Mills has tap  them for everything, from packaging to design innovation to novel ingredients suggestions. 

At Alternative iGrow that company I have co-founded we work with big companies and provide  rich and deep answers to Marketing Executives so they can develop and market products and services successfully. 

How it works?: 
We crowdsource answers for marketing and product development through a digital platform were we invite our target group to “play” and interact. So instead of waiting with a thick paper binder in a street to fish for answers, or to physically gather consumers in a double mirror room, we engage them via a digital platform. 

They upload pictures and videos using the products, their hero moments, their shopping lists, they play interactive games with the products in questions and as they do so they provide meaningful answers on which product they prefer and why. How they use them and vital questions on pricing, promotion, aesthetics concepts, product features and advertising.

So within 6-8 weeks we have a complete set of answers for the development and marketing of products and services to what before took several months and hundreds of thousands dollars to get them. 

So why crowdsourcing matters so much in our networked society era?
Everything from product development and prototyping can be now crowd sourced. 
Over the next decade the size of the crowd is expected to double. From roughly 3 billion to 5 billion.
The communication technologies are growing exponentially. The penetration of mobile, broadband, internet services will reach 54% or world population by the end of 2017. As  a result the crowd is becoming hyper connected and hyper responsive. 
All of the exponential technologies are accessible to the crowd. The people you can tap for support are far more capable than before.  

So it is for you to think how you can get the best out of a crowdsourcing platform. As a consumer you can evaluate a product and give your feedback for a product that meets your need. As a marketing professional you can save valuable time, effort and big dollars to develop and market products successfully.
85% of products launched in the market place eventually fail posing a waste of money and resources to our society. I predict that the next decade the “networked consumer” effect will help cut this number in half and save our society from wasting its valuable resources.
